Problem Statement
As a leading online home goods retailer, Wayfair is facing significant challenges in managing its data manually. These challenges include inefficient tracking of customer orders and payments, difficulty in updating and retrieving supplier information, difficulty in managing product details and stock levels, and inaccurate tracking of customer information. To address these challenges and meet the expectations of its customers, Wayfair requires an effective online fulfilment database system that streamlines the order management process, ensures efficient and secure payment processing, and provides real-time visibility into supplier information, product details, and customer information.

Objectives
1. Implement an efficient database system to easily store and retrieve customer and supplier information.
2. Introduce a tracking system for customer orders, payments, and order fulfilment status to speed up and streamline the order management process.
3. Automate the process of storing and retrieving product details and stock levels for real-time inventory management.
4. Implement a system for categorizing products and managing product categories.
5. Improve accuracy in storing and retrieving customer information to provide a better customer experience.

Proposed Solution This online database system will allow the user to manage and track orders, sales and deliveries. The database will include a customer database that stores information about users, including tables for storing their order history, their payment method, etc. There will be a product database which comes from a third-party provider or supplier. Each element of this database management system will be tracked and updated based on incoming and outgoing orders. Implementing this system will improve real time consistency, scalability and reduce latency.
